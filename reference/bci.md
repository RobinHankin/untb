# Barro Colorado Island (BCI) dataset

The BCI dataset contains location and species identity for all 10cm dbh
(diameter at breast height) trees on Barro Colorado Island, currently
for years 1981-1983, 1985, 1990, 1995, 2000, and 2005. The subset of
interest here is the abundances for each of the 252 species recorded.

The BCI dataset is not included in the untb package, because its licence
appears to be inconsistent with the GPL.

It is discussed here because it was used as an example dataset in Hankin
2007.
