The `untb` package provides R-centric functionality for working with
Hubbell's unified neutral theory of biogeography and biodiversity.  A
vignette is provided in the package.  The canonical reference is
S. P. Hubbell 2001. "The Unified Neutral Theory of Biodiversity and
Biogeography", Princeton University Press.

# Installation

You can install the released version of the `untb` package from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

```{r, message=FALSE}
# install.packages("untb")  # uncomment this to install the package
library("untb")
set.seed(0)
```

# The `untb` package in use

The package has two main classes, `count` and `census`.  A `count`
object is a named integer vector, with names being species and entries
being respective counts.  Thus:

```{r cliff1}
x <- count(c(cats=9,pigs=3,dogs=2,rats=1,hogs=1,bats=1))
x
summary(x)
```

Above, we see 9 cats, 3 pigs, and so on.  Function `summary()` gives
further information.  A `census` object is an unordered factor with
entries being the species of each individual:

```{r}
as.census(x)
```

The package includes example datasets:

```{r}
data(sahfos)
summary(sahfos)
```

We can give a visual summary of a dataset in two ways:

```{r}
plot(sahfos)
plot(preston(sahfos))
```

The package also includes the ability to generate random neutral
assemblages:

```{r}
summary(rand.neutral(1000,10))
summary(rand.neutral(1000,10))
```
