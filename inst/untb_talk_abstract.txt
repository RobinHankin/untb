The distribution of abundance amongst species with similar ways of
life is a classical problem in ecology.

The Unified Neutral Theory of Biodiversity (UNTB), due to Hubbell,
states that observed population dynamics may be explained on the
assumption of per capita equivalence amongst individuals. One can thus
dispense with differences between species, and differences between
abundant and rare species: all individuals behave alike in respect of
their probabilities of reproducing and death.

It is a striking fact that such a parsimonious theory results in a
non-trivial dominancediversity curve (that is, the simultaneous
existence of both abundant and rare species) and even more striking
that the theory predicts abundance curves that match observations
across a wide range of ecologies.

The UNTB, being a statistical hypothesis, is well-suited to simulation
using the R computer language. Here I discuss the untb package for
numerical simulation of ecological drift under the unified neutral
theory. A range of visualization, analytical, and simulation tools are
provided in the package and these are presented with examples and
discussion.
